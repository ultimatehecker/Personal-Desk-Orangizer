### About the Project
Fully Open-Source CAD for my personal desk drawer to organize all the stuff with the purpose to be fully 3D printed. This is
heavily based on the system Scott Yu-Jan had designed for his desktop draws used for all of his tools, while creating all of these
designs originally to respect his descion of putting his designs for channel members. The drawer I have are linked under the 
description if you would like to replicate this project.

## ðŸš€ Usage
All of the design files are posted in their STL format so they can be directly printed for your use,the STEP files to be
able to be imported in any CAD software, and the Fusion360 + AutoCAD drawings have been included if you would like to import it and edit it. In addition to this, I will be providing all of the gcode files for the printer (A1 Mini) so you can upload and print them without going through the hassle of slicing the files.
