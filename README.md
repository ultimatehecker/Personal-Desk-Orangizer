Fully Open-Source CAD for my personal desk drawer to organize all the stuff with the purpose to be fully 3D printed. This is
heavily based on the system Scott Yu-Jan had designed for his desktop draws used for all of his tools, while creating all of these
designs originally to respect his descion of putting his designs for channel members.
